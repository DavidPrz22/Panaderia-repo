Summary of Current Design Workflow
Your system is designed around a clear, multi-stage inventory and production process. It correctly separates raw materials, intermediate goods, and final products, with a robust lot-tracking system at each stage. The recent addition of tipo_medida_fisica has created a very explicit and powerful way to handle different kinds of products.

Here is the step-by-step workflow:

1. Product Definition (The Blueprint):

Everything starts with the abstract ProductosElaborados model. This is the central point for defining any item you create.
You use the es_intermediario boolean flag and proxy models (ProductosIntermedios, ProductosFinales) to logically separate products that are ingredients for other products from those that are sold to customers.
Key Decision Point: The tipo_medida_fisica field ('UNIDAD', 'PESO', 'VOLUMEN') is the primary classifier for a product. This choice dictates how lots are measured and how the UI should behave.
Sales Logic: For ProductosFinales, you define how it's sold:
If vendible_por_medida_real is False, it's sold as a discrete item (like a single croissant) for a fixed precio_venta_usd.
If vendible_por_medida_real is True, its price is calculated at the point of sale based on its measured weight or volume. The precio_venta_usd then acts as the price per unidad_venta (e.g., price per KG or price per Liter).
2. Production Process:

A user initiates a production run for a specific ProductosElaborados.
The system consumes the necessary stock of MateriasPrimas and/or ProductosIntermedios, using a FEFO (First-Expired, First-Out) logic by finding the lot with the closest expiration date.
The total cost of all consumed components is calculated to determine the production cost.
3. Lot Registration (Capturing the Physical Result):

A new LotesProductosElaborados record is created for the finished batch.
This lot stores the cantidad_inicial_lote (e.g., 10 cakes) and the total coste_total_lote_usd.
Crucially, based on the product's tipo_medida_fisica, the system records either:
peso_total_lote_gramos: The total measured weight of the entire batch.
volumen_total_lote_ml: The total measured volume of the entire batch.
Your clean method on the lot model correctly prevents data entry errors by ensuring a "weight" product cannot have a volume, and vice-versa.

4. Inventory Management:

The stock_actual_lote on the LotesProductosElaborados model tracks the remaining quantity of that specific batch.
The stock_actual on the main ProductosElaborados model aggregates the stock from all available lots.
Your @property methods (peso_promedio_por_unidad, volumen_promedio_por_unidad) are useful helpers for providing estimated data, although the sales process will rely on real-time measurements for vendible_por_medida_real products.
This design is robust, logical, and handles the complexities of bakery production well. It clearly separates the definition of a product from the physical reality of each production batch.
